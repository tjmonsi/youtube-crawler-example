# youtube-crawler-example
A simple youtube crawler web app

It just plays with extracting youtube video information using the search and videos api.
You can find more at  https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list for search
and https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos for videos

## What it can't do
It can't extract file details (like date and location uploaded, etc...) due to it being restricted only to the owner of the video
